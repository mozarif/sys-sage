     * @brief Represents a data path (arbitrary relation or data movement) between two Components in the topology.
     *
     * DataPaths form a data-path graph, which is orthogonal to the Component Tree. Each Component contains references
     * to all DataPaths going to or from it, in addition to its parent and children in the Component Tree. This enables
     * navigation between Components and access to data stored in Components or DataPaths.
     *
     * DataPaths can be oriented (directed) or bidirectional, and can carry additional information such as bandwidth,
     * latency, and user-defined types. They are essential for modeling memory hierarchies, interconnects, and other
     * logical or physical data flows in heterogeneous systems.
