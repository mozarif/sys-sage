     * This class is used to describe the physical or logical connectivity between qubits in a quantum device,
     * typically as part of the quantum hardware abstraction in sys-sage. It inherits from Relation and can
     * represent both directed and undirected couplings, as well as additional properties such as fidelity.

     * and for mapping quantum circuits to hardware. The class supports both pairwise and multi-component couplings.
