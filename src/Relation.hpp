 * @brief Defines the Relation class for modeling connections between components in system topologies.
 *
 * This header provides the Relation class, a core component of the sys-sage library.
 * Relations represent interactions or connections between components in a system topology,
 * enabling flexible modeling and analysis of architectural relationships.
 * Derived classes like DataPath, QuantumGate, and CouplingMap inherit from Relation
 * to represent specific types of connections.

     * @brief Abstract base class representing a multi-way connection among Components.

     * A Relation models a relationship among one or more Components, such as a data path,
     * logical gate, or any other connectivity construct. Derived classes define the specific
     * type and semantics.
     *
     * Key Features:
     * - The @c components vector holds participating components. The @c ordered flag
     *   determines whether their order is semantically meaningful.
     * - The @c id and @c name identify the relation.
     * - The @c type indicates the specific kind of relation (e.g. data path, gate).
     * - The class supports extensible metadata via @c attrib.
     *
     * Clients can use this interface generically or extend it with domain-specific semantics.

        * A map for storing arbitrary pieces of information or data.
        * - The `key` denotes the name of the attribute.
        * - The `value` points to the data, stored as a `void*`.
        *
        * This data structure is designed to store a wide variety of data types by
        * utilizing pointers to void. Due to its flexibility, it is essential to manage
        * the types and memory allocation/deallocation carefully to avoid issues such
        * as memory leaks or undefined behavior.
        *
        * Usage:
        * 
        * 1. Adding a new key-value pair:
        * 
        * ```cpp
        * std::string key = "exampleKey";
        * int* value = new int(42); // Dynamically allocate memory for the value
        * attrib[key] = static_cast<void*>(value); // Store the value in the map
        * ```
        * 
        * 2. Retrieving data from an existing key:
        * 
        * ```cpp
        * std::string key = "exampleKey";
        * if (attrib.find(key) != attrib.end()) {
        *     int* retrievedValue = static_cast<int*>(attrib[key]);
        *     std::cout << "Value: " << *retrievedValue << std::endl;
        * } else {
        *     std::cout << "Key not found." << std::endl;
        * }
        * ```
        * 
        * 3. Checking for the existence of a key:
        * 
        * ```cpp
        * std::string key = "exampleKey";
        * if (attrib.find(key) != attrib.end()) {
        *     std::cout << "Key exists." << std::endl;
        * } else {
        *     std::cout << "Key does not exist." << std::endl;
        * }
        * ```
        * 
        * 4. Removing a key-value pair and freeing memory:
        * 
        * ```cpp
        * std::string key = "exampleKey";
        * if (attrib.find(key) != attrib.end()) {
        *     int* value = static_cast<int*>(attrib[key]);
        *     delete value; // Free the dynamically allocated memory
        *     attrib.erase(key); // Remove the key-value pair from the map
        * }
        * ```
        * 
        * 5. Updating the value for an existing key:
        * 
        * ```cpp
        * std::string key = "exampleKey";
        * if (attrib.find(key) != attrib.end()) {
        *     int* oldValue = static_cast<int*>(attrib[key]);
        *     delete oldValue; // Free the old value
        *     int* newValue = new int(100); // Allocate new value
        *     attrib[key] = static_cast<void*>(newValue); // Update the map
        * }
        * ```
        * 
        * Note:
        * - Proper memory management is crucial when using `void*` pointers. Always ensure
        *   that dynamically allocated memory is freed when no longer needed.
        * - Type safety is not enforced, so it is important to cast pointers to the correct
        *   type when retrieving values from the map.
