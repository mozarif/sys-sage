    /**
    * A map for storing arbitrary pieces of information or data.
    * - The `key` denotes the name of the attribute.
    * - The `value` points to the data, stored as a `void*`.
    *
    * This data structure is designed to store a wide variety of data types by
    * utilizing pointers to void. Due to its flexibility, it is essential to manage
    * the types and memory allocation/deallocation carefully to avoid issues such
    * as memory leaks or undefined behavior.
    *
    * Usage:
    * 
    * 1. Adding a new key-value pair:
    * 
    * ```cpp
    * std::string key = "exampleKey";
    * int* value = new int(42); // Dynamically allocate memory for the value
    * attrib[key] = static_cast<void*>(value); // Store the value in the map
    * ```
    * 
    * 2. Retrieving data from an existing key:
    * 
    * ```cpp
    * std::string key = "exampleKey";
    * if (attrib.find(key) != attrib.end()) {
    *     int* retrievedValue = static_cast<int*>(attrib[key]);
    *     std::cout << "Value: " << *retrievedValue << std::endl;
    * } else {
    *     std::cout << "Key not found." << std::endl;
    * }
    * ```
    * 
    * 3. Checking for the existence of a key:
    * 
    * ```cpp
    * std::string key = "exampleKey";
    * if (attrib.find(key) != attrib.end()) {
    *     std::cout << "Key exists." << std::endl;
    * } else {
    *     std::cout << "Key does not exist." << std::endl;
    * }
    * ```
    * 
    * 4. Removing a key-value pair and freeing memory:
    * 
    * ```cpp
    * std::string key = "exampleKey";
    * if (attrib.find(key) != attrib.end()) {
    *     int* value = static_cast<int*>(attrib[key]);
    *     delete value; // Free the dynamically allocated memory
    *     attrib.erase(key); // Remove the key-value pair from the map
    * }
    * ```
    * 
    * 5. Updating the value for an existing key:
    * 
    * ```cpp
    * std::string key = "exampleKey";
    * if (attrib.find(key) != attrib.end()) {
    *     int* oldValue = static_cast<int*>(attrib[key]);
    *     delete oldValue; // Free the old value
    *     int* newValue = new int(100); // Allocate new value
    *     attrib[key] = static_cast<void*>(newValue); // Update the map
    * }
    * ```
    * 
    * Note:
    * - Proper memory management is crucial when using `void*` pointers. Always ensure
    *   that dynamically allocated memory is freed when no longer needed.
    * - Type safety is not enforced, so it is important to cast pointers to the correct
    *   type when retrieving values from the map.
