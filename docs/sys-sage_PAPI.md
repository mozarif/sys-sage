# sys-sage PAPI

## General Information

The _sys-sage_ library incorporates the <b>P</b>erformance <b>A</b>pplication
<b>P</b>rogramming <b>I</b>nterface [[1]](#1) (**PAPI**) to enable the integration of
hardware performance counters on CPUs into the _sys-sage_ topology. That way,
the performance metrics gained through PAPI can be attributed directly to the
relevant hardware components, thus allowing for the examination and
interpretation of the performance metrics within the context of the hardware
topology.

To enable this feature, use the `-DPAPI=on` flag when building the _sys-sage_
library.

## General Workflow

The following diagram shows the overall workflow of the PAPI metrics collection
and evaluation through _sys-sage_:

The green boxes correspond to the _sys-sage_ API whereas the blue ones
correspond to plain PAPI. In general, the creation and configuration of event
sets remain with PAPI, while the performance monitoring is now managed
through _sys-sage_.

## API overview

In principle, _sys-sage_ uses a `sys_sage::Relation` object to capture the
performance counter values and to simultaneously relate them to the hardware
threads, which are of type `sys_sage::Thread`, on which they have been
monitored on. To realize the PAPI integration, wrapper functions are provided
that envelop the underlying PAPI routine. They will behave **exactly** like the
underlying PAPI routine, with the added logic of automatically handling the
storage of the performance counter values within the _sys-sage_ topology via
relation management. The wrapper functions are

In general, the _sys-sage_ wrappers can coexist with plain PAPI and can
therefore be used next to the PAPI routines. This extends to routines like
`PAPI_create_eventset`, `PAPI_attach` and so on. However, the wrappers
`SS_PAPI_start`, `SS_PAPI_reset` and `SS_PAPI_accum` **must** be used instead
of `PAPI_start`, `PAPI_reset` and `PAPI_accum` respectively.

To access or display the performance metrics that are integrated into the
_sys-sage_ topology, the following functions are provided

## A brief example

We offer a dedicated [tutorial](../examples/tutorials/Tutorial_07.md) on the PAPI integration, showcasing the basic concepts.
For more sophisticated examples, please have a look at the `examples/`
directory of the _sys-sage_ repository. The examples include

- `papi_multithreading.cpp`: Exploring multihreading in _sys-sage_ PAPI
- `papi_monitor_process.cpp`: Exploring third-party monitoring of another process in _sys-sage_ PAPI
- `papi_migrate_cpus.cpp`: Showcase of performance monitoring on a thread that constantly migrates across CPUs

A minimal example is provided below. Note that error handling has been left out
for the sake of simplicity and clarity. All _sys-sage_ PAPI wrappers have
adopted the return error codes of PAPI. Please refer to PAPI's Wiki for the
error codes and the documentation of the wrappers themselves for more
information.

```cpp
sys_sage::Node *node = new sys_sage::Node;
sys_sage::parseHwlocOutput(node, path_to_hwloc_xml);

PAPI_library_init(PAPI_VER_CURRENT); // initialize the PAPI

int eventSet = PAPI_NULL;
PAPI_create_eventset(&eventSet);
PAPI_add_event(eventSet, PAPI_TOT_INS); // add an event to the event set

// Relation object used to model the relationship between hardware performance
// counters and the respective hardware components
sys_sage::Relation *metrics = nullptr;
sys_sage::SS_PAPI_start(eventSet, &metrics); // the relation now represents the event set

// do some computation...

sys_sage::SS_PAPI_stop(metrics, node); // stop profiling and store metrics in the relation

metrics->PrintPAPImetrics(); // print results

PAPI_cleanup_eventset(eventSet);
PAPI_destroy_eventset(&eventSet);
PAPI_shutdown(); // clean up resources and terminate PAPI
```

## Implementation Details

Let's provide some definitions:

- "software thread": a software abstraction of an independant execution stream
                     within a process.

- "hardware thread": an independant execution unit in hardware.

- "CPU": the same as a hardware thread

### What happens under the hood?

The wrappers `SS_PAPI_read`, `SS_PAPI_accum` and `SS_PAPI_stop` all follow a
very similar strategy:

1. Based on the given event set, determine the events associated to it and
   store the event codes in a local array called `events`.

2. Perform the call to the underlying PAPI routine using a local array called
   `counters`.

   - `SS_PAPI_read`  -> `PAPI_read`

   - `SS_PAPI_accum` -> `PAPI_accum`

   - `SS_PAPI_stop`  -> `PAPI_stop`

3. Depending on the event set, figure out to which hardware thread the counters
   belong to and find its ID. Here, we need to make a case destinction:

   - If the event set has explicitely been attached to a hardware thread,
     simply query for the ID through PAPI.

   - If the event set has explicitely been attached to a software thread, get
     the last known hardware thread on which it was scheduled on by reading
     `/proc/<tid>/stat`.

   - Otherwise, the event set is implicitely attached to the current software
     thread, in which case we simply call `sched_getcpu()`.

   In the last two cases, the software thread can potentially migrate across
   multiple hardware threads through repeated re-scheduling. Since PAPI uses
   `perf_event_open` internally, the Linux kernel will preserve the
   intermediate performance counter values across context switches. To "keep
   track" of these hardware threads and to attribute the performance counter
   values to them, a relation object with the new relation category
   `RelationCategory::PAPI_Metrics` is used.

4. Together with the ID of the hardware thread, query for its handle in the
   _sys-sage_ topology. If the hardware thread is not already contained in the
   `Relation` object, it will be added to it.

5. Store the values of `counters` into the `attrib` map of the relation object
    on a per-event basis, meaning that if the value `counters[i]` at
   index `i` corresponds to the event `events[i]`, we will have a key-value
   pair similar to `{ events[i], counters[i] }`. Note that the values are
   actually stored as entries of a datastructure and that the string
   representation of the event code is used as the actual key. More detail is
   given below.

### Multiple Performance Counter Readings

We define a "performance counter reading" to be the act of fetching the current
values of the performance counters. It may be triggered by a call to either
`SS_PAPI_read`, `SS_PAPI_accum` or `SS_PAPI_stop`.

Now, the _sys-sage_ library allows the user to store the results of multiple
performance counter readings of the same event. To distinguish them from one
another, timestamps have been introduced. A timestamp is always associated to
the entire reading, meaning that performance counter values of different events
share the same timestamp within the same reading. It is important to state that
these timestamps are **not** guaranteed to be unique for every reading --
although most likely they will -- and in case of a collision, the value of the
latter reading will be returned.

### Rules for the Storage Mechanism of the Performance Counter Values

For the purpose of simplicity, we will focus on single-event event sets in this
section. Everything described here can be easily extended to multiple events.

Let's define the operations _READ_, _RESET_ and _ACCUM_, which correspond to
the respective PAPI routines. We have

- _READ_: capture the perf current counter value and store it

- _RESET_: set the perf counter to 0

- _ACCUM_: capture the current value of the perf counter, add it to some data,
           and perform the _RESET_ operation

Furthermore, each entry of the datastructure containing the perf counter values
can be either in the _permanent_ or _temporary_ mode (indicated by a parameter).
If an entry is temporary, it may be overwritten by some new perf counter reading.
If it is permanent, it may not be modified again, and therefore a new entry
must be added to the datastructure.

Now, the rules are as follows:

1. If a _RESET_ operation is followed by a _READ_ operation, all temporary
   entries on all CPUs of that specific event will be deleted.

2. If there are no more entries in the datastructure of a CPU, that CPU will
   be removed from the relation.

3. The value extracted from a _READ_ operation will be "split" among all CPUs
   whose latest entry is temporary and contains a value that stems from the
   latest reading.

If $x$ is the value gained from a _READ_ operation on CPU $a$ and $y$ is the
sum of values of all CPUs in the relation that satisfy the above conditions,
then the result $z := x - y$ is stored in an entry corresponding to CPU $a$.

4. The value extracted from an _ACCUM_ operation will be "merged" with all CPUs
   whose latest entry is permanent and contains a value that stems from the
   latest reading.

If $x$ is the value gained from an _ACCUM_ operation on CPU $a$ and $y$ is the
sum of values of all CPUs in the relation that satisfy the above conditions,
then the result $z := x + y$ is stored in an entry corresponding to CPU $a$.
