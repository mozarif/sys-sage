# Find the NUMACTL libraries and include dir

# NUMACTL_INCLUDE_DIRS  - Directories to include to use NUMACTL
# NUMACTL_LIBRARIES     - Files to link against to use NUMACTL
# NUMACTL_LIB_DIR       - The directory containing NUMACTL_LIBRARIES
# NUMACTL_FOUND         - When false, don't try to use NUMACTL
#
# NUMACTL_DIR can be used to make it simpler to find the various include
# directories and compiled libraries when NUMACTL was not installed in the
# usual/well-known directories (e.g. because you made an in tree-source
# compilation or because you installed it in an "unusual" directory).
# Just set NUMACTL_DIR it to your specific installation directory
